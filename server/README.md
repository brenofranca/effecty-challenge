# Getting started

## Installation

Please check the official laravel installation guide for server requirements before you start. [Official Documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/5.4/installation#installation)

Clone the repository

    git clone git@github.com:brenofranca/effecty-challenge.git

Switch to the repo folder

    cd effecty-challenge/server

Install all the dependencies using composer

    composer install

Copy the example env file and make the required configuration changes in the .env file

    cp .env.example .env

Generate a new application key

    php artisan key:generate

Generate a new JWT authentication secret key

    php artisan jwt:generate

Run the database migrations (**Set the database connection in .env before migrating**)

    php artisan migrate --seed

Start the local development server

    php artisan serve

You can now access the server at http://localhost:8000

**TL;DR command list**

    git clone git@github.com:brenofranca/effecty-challenge.git
    cd effecty-challenge/server
    composer install
    cp .env.example .env
    php artisan key:generate
    php artisan jwt:generate 
    
**Make sure you set the correct database connection information before running the migrations** [Environment variables](#environment-variables)

    php artisan migrate --seed
    php artisan serve

## Database seeding

**Populate the database with seed data with relationships which includes user, licitations and participants. This can help you to quickly start testing the api or couple a frontend and start using it with ready content.**

Open the DatabaseSeeder and set the property values as per your requirement

    database/seeds/DatabaseSeeder.php

Run the database seeder and you're done

    php artisan db:seed

***Note*** : It's recommended to have a clean database before seeding. You can refresh your migrations at any point to clean the database by running the following command

    php artisan migrate:refresh
